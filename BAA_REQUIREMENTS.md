## What is a BAA?

A Business Associate Agreement (BAA) is a legal contract required by HIPAA between a covered entity (you) and a business associate (vendor) that:
- Defines how PHI will be protected
- Limits how PHI can be used
- Requires notification of breaches
- Ensures HIPAA compliance

## Why are BAAs Critical?

- **Legal Requirement**: HIPAA requires BAAs with ALL vendors handling PHI
- **Liability Protection**: Without BAAs, you're liable for vendor breaches
- **Fines**: Up to $2 million per violation without proper BAAs
- **Patient Trust**: Demonstrates commitment to privacy

### Before Launch (MUST HAVE):
- [ ] Supabase BAA signed
- [ ] Twilio BAA signed

## Cost Implications

| Vendor | Current | HIPAA-Compliant | Additional Cost |
|--------|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Supabase | Free/Pro | Enterprise | ~$500+/month |
| Twilio | Pay-as-you-go | Same + BAA | No extra cost |
| Email | Resend | SendGrid | ~$15-90/month |

## Temporary Workaround

Until BAAs are in place:
1. **Disclaimer Mode**: Add prominent disclaimer that app is not HIPAA-compliant
2. **Wellness Mode**: Position as wellness app, not medical app
3. **No PHI Mode**: Disable features that collect health information
4. **Test Mode**: Use only with test data
