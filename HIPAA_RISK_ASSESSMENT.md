# HIPAA Risk Assessment - Kin-Reach Application

## Executive Summary
This risk assessment identifies potential vulnerabilities in the handling of Protected Health Information (PHI) within the Kin-Reach recovery support application and provides mitigation strategies.

## Risk Assessment Methodology
- **Likelihood Scale**: Low (1), Medium (2), High (3)
- **Impact Scale**: Low (1), Medium (2), High (3)
- **Risk Score**: Likelihood Ã— Impact (1-9)

## Identified Risks and Mitigation Strategies

### 1. Third-Party Service Providers Without BAAs
- **Risk**: PHI transmitted to vendors without Business Associate Agreements
- **Likelihood**: High (3) - Currently using services without BAAs
- **Impact**: High (3) - Potential HIPAA violation and data breach
- **Risk Score**: 9 (CRITICAL)
- **Current Controls**: None
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Immediately obtain BAAs from Supabase, Twilio, and email providers
  - Suspend PHI transmission until BAAs are in place
  - Consider HIPAA-compliant alternatives

### 2. Lack of Field-Level Encryption for Sensitive PHI
- **Risk**: PHI stored in database without field-level encryption
- **Likelihood**: Medium (2) - Database encrypted at rest, but not field-level
- **Impact**: High (3) - Potential exposure if database is compromised
- **Risk Score**: 6 (HIGH)
- **Current Controls**: 
  - Database encryption at rest (Supabase)
  - TLS encryption in transit
  - Row-level security
- **Mitigation**:
  - Implement field-level encryption for highly sensitive data
  - Use application-level encryption for phone numbers, messages
  - Consider format-preserving encryption for searchable fields

### 3. Missing Consent Management
- **Risk**: No comprehensive system for tracking patient consent
- **Likelihood**: Medium (2) - Basic SMS consent exists
- **Impact**: Medium (2) - Regulatory compliance issue
- **Risk Score**: 4 (MEDIUM)
- **Current Controls**: SMS opt-in consent
- **Mitigation**:
  - Implement comprehensive consent tracking
  - Add consent timestamps and versioning
  - Create consent audit trail

### 4. Insufficient Access Controls for Support Network
- **Risk**: Support team members might access more PHI than necessary
- **Likelihood**: Low (1) - RLS policies in place
- **Impact**: Medium (2) - Potential privacy violation
- **Risk Score**: 2 (LOW)
- **Current Controls**: 
  - Row-level security
  - User authentication
- **Mitigation**:
  - Implement granular permissions
  - Add time-based access restrictions
  - Regular access reviews

### 5. Mobile Device Security
- **Risk**: PHI accessed on unsecured mobile devices
- **Likelihood**: High (3) - Mobile app without device controls
- **Impact**: Medium (2) - Potential data exposure
- **Risk Score**: 6 (HIGH)
- **Current Controls**: 
  - Session timeout
  - HTTPS only
- **Mitigation**:
  - Implement app-level PIN/biometric authentication
  - Add remote wipe capability
  - Enforce device encryption checks

### 6. Audit Log Integrity
- **Risk**: Audit logs could be tampered with
- **Likelihood**: Low (1) - Database controls in place
- **Impact**: High (3) - Compliance and forensics impact
- **Risk Score**: 3 (LOW)
- **Current Controls**: 
  - Database-level security
  - Append-only design
- **Mitigation**:
  - Implement cryptographic log signing
  - Regular log backups
  - Log integrity monitoring

### 7. Incident Response Readiness
- **Risk**: No formal incident response plan
- **Likelihood**: Medium (2) - Incidents are likely over time
- **Impact**: High (3) - Breach notification delays
- **Risk Score**: 6 (HIGH)
- **Current Controls**: Basic security monitoring
- **Mitigation**:
  - Create formal incident response plan
  - Conduct tabletop exercises
  - Establish response team

### 8. Data Retention and Disposal
- **Risk**: PHI retained longer than necessary
- **Likelihood**: Medium (2) - No automated disposal
- **Impact**: Medium (2) - Increased breach surface
- **Risk Score**: 4 (MEDIUM)
- **Current Controls**: Manual deletion available
- **Mitigation**:
  - Implement automated retention policies
  - Create secure deletion procedures
  - Regular retention audits

### 9. Backup and Recovery
- **Risk**: PHI backups not properly secured
- **Likelihood**: Low (1) - Supabase manages backups
- **Impact**: High (3) - Potential massive breach
- **Risk Score**: 3 (LOW)
- **Current Controls**: Provider-managed backups
- **Mitigation**:
  - Verify backup encryption
  - Test recovery procedures
  - Document backup access controls

### 10. Workforce Training
- **Risk**: Staff unaware of HIPAA requirements
- **Likelihood**: High (3) - No training program
- **Impact**: Medium (2) - Unintentional violations
- **Risk Score**: 6 (HIGH)
- **Current Controls**: None
- **Mitigation**:
  - Develop training program
  - Annual training requirement
  - Track completion

## Risk Summary

### Critical Risks (Score 7-9)
1. Third-party providers without BAAs (9)

### High Risks (Score 4-6)
1. Lack of field-level encryption (6)
2. Mobile device security (6)
3. Incident response readiness (6)
4. Workforce training (6)
5. Missing consent management (4)
6. Data retention and disposal (4)

### Low Risks (Score 1-3)
1. Audit log integrity (3)
2. Backup and recovery (3)
3. Support network access controls (2)

## Recommended Action Plan

### Immediate (Within 7 days)
1. Obtain BAAs from all vendors handling PHI
2. Assign Security and Privacy Officers
3. Suspend non-critical PHI processing until BAAs secured

### Short-term (Within 30 days)
1. Implement field-level encryption
2. Create incident response plan
3. Develop workforce training program
4. Enhance mobile security

### Medium-term (Within 90 days)
1. Implement consent management system
2. Automate data retention policies
3. Conduct first training session
4. Complete security audit

### Long-term (Within 180 days)
1. Achieve full HIPAA compliance
2. Obtain third-party certification
3. Establish ongoing compliance program

## Conclusion
The Kin-Reach application has strong security fundamentals but requires immediate attention to vendor agreements and several high-risk areas to achieve HIPAA compliance. The most critical issue is the lack of Business Associate Agreements with vendors handling PHI.
