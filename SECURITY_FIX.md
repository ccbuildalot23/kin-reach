# Security Vulnerability Analysis - December 2024

## Issue
GitHub Dependabot detected a moderate severity vulnerability in esbuild <=0.24.2:
- **Vulnerability**: GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99
- **Impact**: esbuild enables any website to send any requests to the development server and read the response
- **Severity**: Moderate
- **Affected Package**: vite@5.4.19 depends on esbuild@0.21.5

## Analysis
1. This vulnerability **only affects development servers**, not production builds
2. The vulnerability allows websites to read responses from the dev server
3. Since this is a recovery app MVP launching to App Store, production builds are not affected

## Current Status
- Attempted to upgrade to Vite 6.3.5 (which uses non-vulnerable esbuild ^0.25.0)
- Vite 6 has parsing incompatibilities with our JSX template literals
- Reverted to Vite 5.4.19 to maintain functionality for App Store launch

## Risk Assessment
- **Production Risk**: None (vulnerability only affects dev server)
- **Development Risk**: Low (dev server is only used locally)
- **Recommendation**: Accept the risk for now, upgrade after App Store launch

## Future Mitigation
After App Store launch:
1. Refactor template literal syntax for Vite 6 compatibility
2. Upgrade to Vite 6.x or 7.x
3. Run comprehensive testing

## Workaround for Development
When running dev server:
- Only access from localhost
- Don't expose dev server to network
- Use production builds for any external testing
