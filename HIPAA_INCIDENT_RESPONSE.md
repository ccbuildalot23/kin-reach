## Response Procedures

### Phase 1: Detection and Analysis (0-4 hours)

1. **Initial Detection**
   ```
   - Record incident details in Incident Log
   - Note: Date, time, reporter, initial description
   - Assign incident ID: INC-YYYY-MM-DD-###
   ```

2. **Immediate Assessment**
   - Is PHI involved? (Yes/No)
   - Number of records potentially affected
   - Type of PHI exposed
   - How the incident occurred
   - Current status (ongoing/contained)

3. **Activate Response Team**
   - Notify Security Officer immediately
   - Convene response team within 2 hours
   - Begin incident documentation

### Phase 2: Containment (0-24 hours)

1. **Short-term Containment**
   - Isolate affected systems
   - Disable compromised accounts
   - Block malicious IPs/domains
   - Preserve evidence (screenshots, logs)

2. **System Backup**
   ```bash
   # Preserve evidence before changes
   - Database snapshot
   - Audit log export
   - System state capture
   ```

3. **Long-term Containment**
   - Apply security patches
   - Update access controls
   - Implement additional monitoring

### Phase 3: Eradication (24-72 hours)

1. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - How did the incident occur?
   - What vulnerabilities were exploited?
   - Timeline reconstruction

2. **Threat Removal**
   - Remove malware/unauthorized access
   - Close security gaps
   - Update security controls

### Phase 4: Recovery (72+ hours)

1. **System Restoration**
   - Restore from clean backups
   - Rebuild compromised systems
   - Verify system integrity

2. **Monitoring**
   - Enhanced monitoring for 30 days
   - Daily security reports
   - Threat hunting activities

### Phase 5: Post-Incident (Within 60 days)

1. **Breach Assessment**
   - Was PHI accessed or acquired?
   - Risk of harm assessment
   - Notification requirements

2. **Notifications** (if required)
   
   **Individual Notice (within 60 days)**
   - Written notice via mail
   - Email if authorized
   - Substitute notice if needed
   
   **HHS Notice (within 60 days)**
   - Submit breach report online
   - https://ocrportal.hhs.gov
   
   **Media Notice (within 60 days if >500 individuals)**
   - Prominent media outlet
   - Website posting

3. **Lessons Learned**
   - Incident review meeting
   - Update response procedures
   - Implement improvements
